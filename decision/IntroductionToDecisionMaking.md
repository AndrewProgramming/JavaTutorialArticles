# Decision Making in Java

Decision Making in programming is similar to decision making in real life. In programming also we face some situations where we want a certain block of code to be executed when some condition is fulfilled. A programming language uses control statements to control the flow of execution of program based on certain conditions. These are used to cause the flow of execution to advance and branch based on changes to the state of a program.
