#### Multithreading

**Multithreading** is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. Each part of such program is called a thread. So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.Java provides exceptionally good support for creating and running threads and for locking resources to prevent conflicts.

Threads can be created by using two mechanisms :

1. Extending the `Thread` class
2. Implementing the `Runnable` Interface

##### Thread creation by extending the Thread class

We create a class that extends the **java.lang.Thread** class. This class overrides the `run()` method available in the Thread class. A thread begins its life inside `run()` method. We create an object of our new class and call `start()` method to start the execution of a thread. `Start()` invokes the `run()` method on the Thread object.

Code below shows how to define a class extends Thread class to achive multithreading.

```java
  // Java code for thread creation by extending
// the Thread class
  static class MultithreadingDemo extends Thread {

    public void run() {
      try {
        // Displaying the thread that is running
        System.out.println("Thread " +
            Thread.currentThread().getId() +
            " is running");

      } catch (Exception e) {
        // Throwing an exception
        System.out.println("Exception is caught");
      }
    }
  }
```

Then create two threads:

```java
Thread threadOne = new MultithreadingDemo();
Thread threadTwo = new MultithreadingDemo();

threadOne.start();
threadTwo.start();
```

output:

```java
Thread 11 is running
Thread 12 is running
```

#### Thread creation by Implementing `Runnable` interface

```java
  // Java code for thread creation by implementing
// the Runnable Interface
  static class MultithreadingRunnableDemo implements Runnable {

    public void run() {
      try {
        // Displaying the thread that is running
        System.out.println("Thread " +
            Thread.currentThread().getId() +
            " is running");

      } catch (Exception e) {
        // Throwing an exception
        System.out.println("Exception is caught");
      }
    }
  }
```

Then

```java
Runnable threadThree = new MultithreadingRunnableDemo();
Runnable threadFour = new MultithreadingRunnableDemo();

Thread threadObjectOne = new Thread(threadThree);
Thread threadObjectTwo = new Thread(threadFour);

threadObjectOne.start();
threadObjectTwo.start();
```

Output:

```java
Thread 13 is running
Thread 14 is running	
```

#### Thread Class vs Runnable Interface

1. If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other class because Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance. But, if we implement the Runnable interface, our class can still extend other base classes.
2. We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread class because it provides some inbuilt methods like yield(), interrupt() etc. that are not available in Runnable interface.
