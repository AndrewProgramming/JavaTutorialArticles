#Identifier in java

Identifiers are the names that identify the elements such as classes, methods, and

variables in a program.

- An identifier is a sequence of characters that consists of letters, digits, underscores

(_), and dollar signs ($).

- An identifier must start with a letter, an underscore (_ ), or a dollar sign ($ ). It cannot

start with a digit.

- An identifier cannot be a reserved word.

- An identifier cannot be true , false , or null .

- An identifier can be of any length.

# Example

```java
public class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int a = 20;
    }
}
```

In the above java code, we have 5 identifiers namely :

- **Test** : class name.
- **main** : method name.
- **String** : predefined class name.
- **args** : variable name.
- **a** :  variable name.
